# Deactivate Property
Sending a DELETE for an onboarded property will deactivate the property in Expedia's system.  Content will not be deleted, only the property's state will be changed to inactive.  The property can later be re-enabled using the SetPropertyDetails API call.

## Example

DELETE /properties/v1/mycompany/1234

```javascript

need example

```
