## How to Get Started for First Time API Users
In order to get started with using the API, it is required to register with Expedia and obtain API credentials. It is also possible to obtain the rights to use a test property to run some tests before going to production with a new integration. To get started, new partners need to send an email to eqcss@expedia.com.

## How to Get Authorized to Access Specific Properties
In order to be able to manage properties in production, partners need to be authorized by either Expedia, or the properties that chose to do business with their system.

After a partner successfully registered with Expedia (see [above section](#/howtogetstarted) for details on how to get started), properties can decide to select the partner and authorize them via Expedia PartnerCentral. When this happens, the partner will get an email notification. The email will contain the confirmation that the partner is now authorized to manage this hotel via API calls. It will also either contain a specific set of credentials for this property, or will indicate that the partner's unique account was authorized to manage this additional property. Whether a partner is given a unique account, or one per property, is decided at time of registration with Expedia.
