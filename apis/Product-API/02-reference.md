# API Reference
The Product API will enable our hotels partners to create and edit their room types and rate plans via APIs, without having to use EPC or contact their market manager. The API also enables our partners to read the definition of the room types and rate plans created in the system.

## API Principles & Standards

- **HTTP 1.1** : Our API only supports HTTP 1.1. Requests made with HTTP 1.0 explicitly will be denied.
- **JSON** : The service will return JSON documents for read, create, and update requests, and accept JSON payloads for create and update requests.
- **Secure HTTP w/TLS v1.1+** : The API is only available via HTTPS, and supports GET (read), POST (create), and PUT (update) operations. Our API will not accept connections using SSL or TLS v1.0 protocol. We will only establish connections with TLS v1.1+ protocol.
- **REST** : The service adheres to REST principles and exposes three resources: Rate Plans, Room Types, and Properties.
- **MUST-IGNORE** : The service is constantly evolving and we expect consumers of our service to enforce a must-ignore policy. If the Product API starts returning additional data elements in responses, partners should ignore the data elements they do not need. Partners should also be able to serve the additional data back in an update request, as our update requests are full overlay, and failure to provide additional data back in update requests could cause data to be removed.
- **Entity** : All responses returned by EPS services are encapsulated within an HTTP Entity. Entity is used as a way to make responses generic across different operations. The Entity element may represent a single object, or multiple objects; if the latter, it would be an array. When partners integrate with our APIs, in most cases, they will use serialization/deserialization to deal with messages natively, using the programming language of their choice. 
- **Errors** : Alternatively, if the request produces errors, the response will return an array of one or more errors. If Errors are present, Entity will not be present.

## HTTP Status Code

The API will leverage HTTP status codes as defined by RFC 2616, Section 10. More specifically, users should expect the following from the API: 

| Status Code | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 200 | Success for read and update operations |
| 201 | Success for create operations |
| 400 | Errors induced by user due to incorrect input |
| 401 | Authentication error |
| 403 | Authorization error |
| 404 | Invalid resource |
| 405 | Invalid/unsupported method on resource |
| 406 | Unsupported media type for response (only JSON supported) |
| 409 | Conflicting data |
| 415 | Unsupported media type (only JSON is supported) |
| 500 | Internal system error (shouldn’t be retried) |
| 503 | Internal system error (should be retried) |

## HTTP Headers
Headers are slightly different between a request made to the EPS Product API, and responses returned.

### Format – Request
| Header | Type | Required | Input Format |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| Authorization | String | Required | Authorization: Basic <username:password encoded by Base64> |
| Content-Type | String | Required* | Content-Type: application/json |
| Accept | String | Required | Accept: application/json |
| Request-ID | String | Optional | Can be provided by the partner and can be referenced later on for troubleshooting purposes. When provided by the partner, it can be anything, and no validations will be performed to insure uniqueness of this ID. If it is not provided in request, API will generate a UUID and return it in the response.  |
*required for create and modify requests only

### Format – Response
| Header | Type | Input Format |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ |
| Content-Type | String | Content-Type: application/json |
| Request-ID | String | Partner-provided request identifier. If it was not provided in the request, Expedia will generate a UUID and return it in the response |
| Transaction-ID | GUID | Unique transaction ID generated by Expedia for all messages. Expedia recommends storing this identifier. Can be used to reference messages when troubleshooting with Expedia |

If a single smoking option is provided, then the room is, by default, only available in this configuration.
