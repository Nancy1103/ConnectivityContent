# Understanding Expedia Lodging Data Model
In the Expedia lodging data model, properties, room types and rate plans are stored according to the following hierarchy:
- Each property has 0 or more room types
- Each room type has one or more rate plans
- Each rate plan belongs to a single room type
- Each rate plan is associated with a single cancellation policy and a single set of additional guest amounts.
The Product API enables partners to first create a room type, and subsequently create rate plans for that room type. For every room type created, the partner is expected to add rate plans to it even if the system will not enforce this rule automatically.

# API Principles & Standards

- **JSON** : The service will return JSON documents for read, create, and update requests, and accept JSON payloads for create and update requests.
- **Secure HTTP** : The API is available via HTTPS, and supports GET (read), POST (create), and PUT (update) operations.
- **REST** : The service adheres to REST principles and exposes three resources: Rate Plans, Room Types, and Properties.
- **HTTP Status Code** : The API will leverage HTTP status codes as defined by RFC 2616, Section 10. More specifically, users should expect the following from the API: 

| Status Code | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 200 | Success for read and update operations |
| 201 | Success for create operations |
| 400 | Errors induced by user due to incorrect input |
| 401 | Authentication error |
| 403 | Authorization error |
| 404 | Invalid resource |
| 405 | Invalid/unsupported method on resource |
| 406 | Unsupported media type for response (only JSON supported) |
| 409 | Conflicting data |
| 415 | Unsupported media type (only JSON supported) |
| 500 | Internal system error (shouldn’t be retried) |
| 503 | Internal system error (should be retried, following logic specified in HTTP response header) |
- **MUST-IGNORE** : The service is constantly evolving and we expect consumers of our service to enforce a must-ignore policy. If the Product API starts returning additional data elements in responses, partners should ignore the data elements they do not need. 
- **Entity** : All responses returned by EPS services are encapsulated within an HTTP Entity. Entity is used as a way to make responses generic across different operations. The Entity element may represent a single object, or multiple objects; if the latter, it would be an array. When partners integrate with our APIs, in most cases, they will use serialization/deserialization to deal with messages natively, using the programming language of their choice. 
- **Errors** : Alternatively, if the request produces errors, the response will return an array of one or more errors. If Errors are present, Entity will not be present.

# HTTP Headers
## Format – Request
| Header | Type | Required | Input Format |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| Authorization | String | Required | Authorization: Basic <username:password encoded by Base64> |
| Content-Type | String | Required* | Content-Type: application/json |
| Accept | String | Required | Accept: application/json |
| Request-ID | String | Optional | Request-ID: UUID This request ID can be provided by the partner and can be referenced later on for troubleshooting purposes. If it is not provided in request, API will generate one and return it in the response. If provided, API will return the same header in the response. |
* required for create and modify requests only

## Format – Response
| Header | Type | Input Format |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ |
| Content-Type | String | Content-Type: application/json |
| Request-ID | String | Partner-provided request identifier. If provided in the request, will be returned in the response |
| Transaction-ID | GUID | Unique transaction ID generated by Expedia for all messages. Expedia recommends storing this identifier. Can be used to reference messages when troubleshooting with Expedia. |

# Basic response structure with Entity and Errors
All responses provided by the API will either contain an HTTP Entity element, which may represent a single object or an array of objects, or an Errors object for an array of errors. 

## Entity
The entities we support with this API are room type, rate plan and property. These will be described in details in subsequent sections.

The Entity approach allows partners to use the same wrapper for all resources exposed by the new generation of Expedia Partner Services like the EPS-Product and EPS-Promo services. 

Consider the following code in Java:
```Java
public class ResponseWrapperDTO<T> implements Serializable {
    private T entity;
    private List<ErrorDTO> errors;
}
```
Entities can be ProductDTO/RatePlanDTO/RoomTypeDTO/PropertyDTO etc.
Simple entity response:
```JSON
{
  "entity": {
    "resourceId": 123,
    ...
  }
}
```
If a response doesn’t contain an Entity, it will contain Errors:
```JSON
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1000,
      "message": "Access denied: your account is not authorized to manage this property."
    }
  ]
}
```
## Entity vs Errors
Entity and errors are in the same wrapper because most frameworks will de-serialize responses automatically, but require a target type to which the response will be de-serialized.
Both successful and unsuccessful responses are returned by the same DTO, but can have either entity or errors, never both.
A Java implementation to handle this, using Spring’s RestTemplate, could look like this:
```Java
   ResponseEntity<ResponseWrapperDTO<ProductDTO>> response = restTemplate.exchange(
            "url",
            HttpMethod.POST,
            entity,
            new ParameterizedTypeReference<ResponseWrapperDTO<ProductDTO>>() {});
```
