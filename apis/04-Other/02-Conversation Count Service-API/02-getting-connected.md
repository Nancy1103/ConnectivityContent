# Getting Connected

To register for an API key and get approved as a developer to begin using Conversation Count Service, follow these steps: 

1) Contact Alfred Wong <alfwong@expedia.com> in order to request a Conversation Count Service API key.

2) We will respond once your key has been approved, it will then be available for immediate usage.

API Key is per developer partner. Once your key has been activated you can use the same key for all hotels that are a part of your system. 
We do NOT require a seperate API key per hotel.
