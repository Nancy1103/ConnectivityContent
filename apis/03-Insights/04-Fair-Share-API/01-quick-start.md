# Quick Start

The FairShare API returns a hotel’s expected fair share and actual market share per stay dates. 
The equation for fair share is my room count /(my room count + my competitors' total room count). 
The equation for actual share is my bookings /(my bookings + my competitors’ total bookings)

----

## Authentication
Each request should include hotelier credentials in HTTP basic auth format, a clientId query parameter, a dayNum query parameter, and a hotelId query parameter.

----

## Reading Fair Share Data

To retreive fair share data pass a hotel id and number of days along with the required authentication parameters to the ```public/v1/fairShare``` endpoint via query parameters.  

```
http://apis.integration.karmalab.net/june-hackathon/insights/public/v1/fairShare?hotelId=759&dayNum=2&clientId=insights-test
```

The response will contain the fair share data in the following format: 

```JSON
{
    "data": {
        "compSetRoomCount": 3322,
        "daily": [
