# Expedia Connectivity API Documentation

As an Expedia partner, or the general public, we would appreciate any and all changes you suggest to the repository (and by extension, the aforementioned website) and suggest they be proposed via pull requests.

This is easiest done on github.com's web interface, though you may of course use the `git` command line tool to create the branch as well, if you prefer.  The steps below are for GitHub's web interface.

## Step 1. Locate file to edit

To find the file(s) you wish to change, either navigate to them from [the repository](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent) or visit the page you wish to edit on [developer.expediapartnercentral.com](https://developer.expediapartnercentral.com) and click on the `Edit on GitHub` link on the top right (non-mobile) to be navigated to the correct page on the repository.

## Step 2. Making changes

Once you have found the page, and clicked on it, there will be a series of icons to edit the page in question, namely the `Edit this file` pencil-icon, and `Delete this file` bin-icon.  Click the `Edit this file` button and you will be dropped into Github's editor.  From here, you may make changes to the markdown files.  To see what sort of things you can do with markdown, visit this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

To view what your changes will look like, click the `preview` button - all changes will be kept, there is no need to save your work.

## Step 3. Committing/saving changes

To commit (a.k.a. save) your work, scroll to the bottom of the currently edited page, in the form, add a title and description of the changes you're making.  Then, select the option `Create a new branch` and add a branch name.  Finally, click `Propose File Change`.

At this point, you have two options:
* Return to the [main repository](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent), select your branch (if currently `master`), and navigate/change more pages, committing changes to the same branch each time, until all your changes are complete.
* Create a pull request - once all your changes are complete, see "Suggesting changes" below

## Step 4. Suggesting changes

Open a pull request - there may be a form on the current web page if you did not make more changes.  If not, go to the main repository and click [pull requests](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ConnectivityContent/pulls) (or visit the link).
* Enter a title and description for the changes in the pull request.
* Click `Create pull request`

Your pull request will now need to be reviewed by Expedia and subsequently merged (or feedback provided) into the master branch.  Thanks for your work!
