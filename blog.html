    <div class="blog-title"><h1>Product :: Delete those old rate plans</h1></div>
    <div class="blog-content">While there are many things that change in the world of Expedia Connectivity, there are a few things that will likely remain the same. First is that we will continue to look for ways to make it easier for you to do business with us. The second is that we will deliver new functionality incrementally.
    <br/><br/>
    Last year when we released the Product API, we made it possible for partners to create and modify rate plans. Naturally, over time, partners have inactivated rate plans that were no longer useful to them. These unused rate plans have an impact on response times and system processing. In addition, unused rate plans create confusion that can make it more difficult for hotel managers to update their room rates. This difficulty can result in costly errors.
    <br/><br/>
    As of a recent Product release, it is now possible to use the HTTP DELETE verb with the Product API to delete a rate plan. To begin using this new feature in your application and make life easier for hotel managers, please refer to the API documentation for <a href="/apis/product-management/product-api/reference.html">Product Delete</a>.</div>
